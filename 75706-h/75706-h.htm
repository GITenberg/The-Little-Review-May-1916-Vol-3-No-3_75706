    <p class="verse">A bending flower rises from its mouth</p>
    <p class="verse">And sways like the vein of a zephyr.</p>
    <p class="verse">Threads of moonlight float entangled over it,</p>
    <p class="verse">Delicate as the breath of a dying woman.</p>
    <p class="verse">Souls come whispering from its ancient lips,</p>
    <p class="verse">Laden with thin secrets,</p>
    <p class="verse">And torn by the long nails of idiot Gods....</p>
    <p class="verse">Pale dancers arise, whirling listlessly,</p>
    <p class="verse">Expiring in a writhing languor.</p>
    <p class="verse">Heavy-lidded eyes crawl out and open vacantly and close....</p>
    <p class="verse">Dried whisps of water break into blue wings.</p>
    <p class="verse">A sleeping woman’s arm reaches up and curves into a sigh</p>

How Not to be An Artist
</p>

<p class="aut">
HAROLD BAUER
</p>

<p class="note">
(<em>No, I cannot write you an article. And I add to this the expression
of my fervent hope that no Amateurs are going to be allowed to scribble
for</em> <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. <em>Speaking as a subscriber, I haven’t the least
desire to read any of H. Bauer’s clumsy attempts to express himself in a
medium that is foreign to him. Let him stick to his business....
You must write the article you have in mind yourself. From the depths of
your artistic intuitions draw forth the material and give away the secrets—which
are no secrets. Moreover, don’t confine yourself to music, much less
to piano playing; take in the whole field of art and call it “The Compleat
Amateur, or, How Not To Be an Artist.” I suggest the following headings.—Extract
from a letter of the Author.</em>)
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="ILESTYLEFAITLHOMME">
I. “<em>Le Style fait l’homme</em>”
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">f</span> you want to become an author, give up your life to the study of
calligraphy, if a painter, devote yourself to the manufacture of paints
and brushes, if a composer, commit to memory the number of notes in
every standard classical work, and if a singer or instrumentalist, spend
your whole energy in the establishing of a “sound technical foundation.”
Emotional expression can then, if desired, be subsequently smeared like
treacle on bread over all these different <a id="corr-0"></a>stylistic bases, this operation requiring
neither skill nor expression.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="IIMEANSTOANEND">
II. “<em>Means to an End</em>”
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The amateur must learn that technique represents an obstacle to be
overcome and a set of tools to be acquired. It has nothing to do with
expression. Only an imaginative artist like Maeterlinck would suggest
that the road along which the student travels towards his destination is
in reality a link, a connection joining one with the other—an umbilical
cord partaking of the nature and attributes of both traveler and goal.
To a perfectly rational person the road is merely a distance to be covered,
a separation.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="IIIPERSONALITYORASSOMEAUTHORITIESHAVEITINDIVIDUALITY">
III. <em>Personality, or, as some authorities have it: Individuality</em>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
This is the greatest asset of the Amateur. An artist is like everybody
in the world. The book we read, the picture we see or the music
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
we hear which renders tangible our own dimly-felt thoughts and emotional
stirrings shows that we are in reality one with the artist and with
the universe of which these expressions are but reflections of unseen
and unheard forces. An artist combines the power and responsibilities
of the aristocrat with the feelings of an anarchist, he is the guardian
of privilege and the destroyer of authority, the leveler of barriers and
the creator of the superman, the leader and the servant of humanity
and ... the Arch Enemy of the Amateur! The artist is like all
humanity, but the Amateur is not like the Artist. The Amateur must
hang on for dear life to his precious soul and resist to the last gasp the
incursions of any outside force in which he can trace the semblance of
his own nature, for if anything gets in something may get out and he
won’t be able to sort himself out afterwards. Hence the Amateur must
be an Individualist; otherwise he is doomed to extinction. The Amateur’s
business is to interpret the universe in terms eternally incomprehensible
to anyone but himself, and to compromise with the necessity for intercourse
with his fellow-creatures by the adoption of an artificial language
which can convey thoughts and feelings of a superficial character, but
nothing more.
</p>

<p>
The tale that points a moral, the picture that suggests a tale, and the
music that evokes a picture; these are the vehicles for “personality”
and your fine amateur must cultivate the pride that the realization of an
exclusive understanding of these things gives. If Hamlet had been an
amateur instead of being an artist he would never have suggested that a
cloud was like a camel, a weasel, or a whale; he would have pointed out
its resemblance to a mathematical calculation or a treatise on political
economy, and Polonius would have been far more impressed—for this
would have shown Great Individuality.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="IVTHEMISSIONOFAMATEURISM">
IV. <em>The Mission of Amateurism</em>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
A true Amateur must learn the value of success, the immense importance
of achievement, the inward meaning of gratified self-conceit.
Praise from small minds represents the highest possible attainment of
accomplished Amateurism. The object of Amateurishness is, like the puzzle
pictures in the daily papers, to present a pretty little problem with a perfectly
simple and obvious solution, thus giving effortless pleasure and satisfaction
to all concerned.
</p>

<p>
The opportunities afforded by collective Amateurism for the repression
of Art are invaluable and as the study of the subject is within the
reach of all, including those who are congenitally afflicted with artistic
talent, it devolves upon everyone who holds the opinion that this is the best
of all possible worlds, to make it his life’s occupation and aim to be a
“compleat amateur”.

SHERWOOD ANDERSON
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> story came to me from a woman, met on a train. The car was
crowded, and I took the seat beside her. There was a man in the
offing, who belonged with her,—a slender, girlish figure of a man, in a
heavy brown canvas coat such as teamsters wear in the winter. He moved
up and down in the aisle of the car, wanting my place by the woman’s
side, but I did not know that at the time.
</p>

<p>
The woman had a heavy face and a thick nose. Something had happened
to her. She had been struck a blow or had a fall. Nature could
never have made a nose so broad and thick and ugly. She talked to me
in very good English. I suspect now that she was temporarily weary of
the man in the brown canvas coat, that she had travelled with him for
days, perhaps weeks, and was glad of the chance to spend a few hours in
the company of some one else.
</p>

<p>
Everyone knows the feeling of a crowded train in the middle of the
night. We ran along through western Iowa and eastern Nebraska. It
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
had rained for days and the fields were flooded. In the clear night the
moon came out and the scene outside the car-window was strange and
in an odd way very beautiful. You get the feeling: the black bare trees
standing up in clusters as they do out in that country, the pools of water
with the moon reflected and running quickly as it does when the train
hurries along, the rattle of the car-trucks, the lights in isolated farmhouses,
and occasionally the clustered lights of a town as the train rushed
through it into the west.
</p>

<p>
The woman had just come out of war-ridden Poland, had got out of
that stricken land with her husband by God knows what miracles of effort.
She made me feel the war, that woman did, and she told me the tale that
I want to tell to you.
</p>

<p>
I don’t remember the beginning of our talk, nor can I tell you of how
the strangeness of my mood grew to match her mood, until the story she
told became a part of the mystery of the still night outside the car-window
and very pregnant with meaning to me.
</p>

<p>
There was a company of Polish refugees moving along a road in
Poland in charge of a German. The German was a man of perhaps fifty,
with a beard. As I got him, he was much such a man as might be professor
of foreign languages in a college in our country, say at Des Moines,
Iowa, or Springfield, Ohio. He would be sturdy and strong of body and
given to the eating of rather rank foods, as such men are. Also he would
be a fellow of books and in his thinking inclined toward the ranker philosophies.
He was dragged into the war because he was a German, and
had steeped his soul in the German philosophy of might. Faintly, I fancy,
there was another notion in his head that kept bothering him, and so to
serve his government with a whole heart he read books that would re-establish
his feeling for the strong, terrible thing for which he fought.
Because he was past fifty he was not on the battle-line, but was in charge
of the refugees, taking them out of their destroyed village to a camp near
a railroad where they could be fed.
</p>

<p>
The refugees were peasants, all except the woman in the American
train with me and her mother, an old woman of sixty-five. They had been
small land-owners and the others in their party were women who had
worked on their estate. Then there was the one man, my companion’s
lover, weak in body and with bad eyes.
</p>

<p>
Along a country road in Poland went this party in charge of the German,
who tramped heavily along, urging them forward. He was brutal
in his insistence, and the old woman of sixty-five, who was a kind of leader
of the refugees, was almost equally brutal in her constant refusal to go
forward. In the rainy night she stopped in the muddy road and her party
gathered about her. Like a stubborn old horse she shook her head and
muttered Polish words. “I want to be let alone, that’s what I want. All
I want in the world is to be let alone,” she said, over and over; and then
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
the German came up, and putting his hand on her back pushed her along,
so that their progress through the dismal night was a constant repetition
of the stopping, her muttered words, and his pushing. They hated each
other with whole-hearted hatred, that old Polish woman and the German.
</p>

<p>
The party came to a clump of trees on the bank of a shallow stream.
The German took hold of the old woman’s arm and dragged her through
the stream while the others followed. Over and over she said the words:
“I want to be let alone. All I want in the world is to be let alone.”
</p>

<p>
In the clump of trees the German started a fire. With incredible
efficiency he had it blazing high in a few minutes, taking the matches and
even some bits of dry wood from a little rubber-lined pouch carried in his
inside coat-pocket. Then he got out tobacco, and, sitting down on the
protruding root of a tree, smoked, and stared at the refugees, clustered
about the old woman on the opposite side of the fire.
</p>

<p>
The German went to sleep. That was what started his trouble. He
slept for an hour, and when he awoke the refugees were gone. You can
imagine him jumping up and tramping heavily back through the shallow
stream and along the muddy road to gather his party together again. He
would be angry through and through, but he would not be alarmed. It
was only a matter, he knew, of going far enough back along the road, as
one goes back along a road for strayed cattle.
</p>

<p>
And then, when the German came up to the party, he and the old
woman began to fight. She stopped muttering the words about being let
alone and sprang at him. One of her old hands gripped his beard and the
other buried itself in the thick skin of his neck.
</p>

<p>
The struggle in the road lasted a long time. The German was tired
and not as strong as he looked, and there was that faint thing in him that
kept him from hitting the old woman with his fist. He took hold of her
thin shoulders and pushed, and she pulled. The struggle was like a man
trying to lift himself by his boot-straps. The two fought and were full
of the determination that will not stop fighting, but they were not very
strong physically.
</p>

<p>
And so their two souls began to struggle. The woman in the train
made me understand that quite clearly, although it may be difficult to get
the sense of it over to you. I had the night and the mystery of the moving
train to help me. It was a physical thing, the fight of the two souls in
the dim light of the rainy night on that deserted muddy road. The air
was full of the struggle, and the refugees gathered about and stood shivering.
They shivered with cold and weariness, of course, but also with
something else. In the air, everywhere about them, they could feel the
vague something going on. The woman said that she would gladly have
given her life to have it stopped, or to have some one strike a light, and
that her man felt the same way. It was like two winds struggling, she
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
said, like a soft yielding cloud become hard and trying vainly to push another
cloud out of the sky.
</p>

<p>
Then the struggle ended and the old woman and the German fell
down exhausted in the road. The refugees gathered about and waited.
They thought something more was going to happen, knew in fact something
more would happen. The feeling they had persisted, you see, and
they huddled together and perhaps whimpered a little.
</p>

<p>
What happened is the whole point of the story. The woman in the
train explained it very clearly. She said that the two souls, after struggling,
went back into the two bodies, but that the soul of the old woman went
into the body of the German and the soul of the German into the body
of the old woman.
</p>

<p>
After that, of course, everything was quite simple. The German sat
down by the road and began shaking his head and saying he wanted to be
let alone, declared that all he wanted in the world was to be let alone, and
the Polish woman took papers out of his pocket and began driving her
companions back along the road, driving them harshly and brutally along,
and when they grew weary pushing them with her hands.
</p>

<p>
There was more of the story after that. The woman’s lover, who
had been a school-teacher, took the papers and got out of the country,
taking his sweetheart with him. But my mind has forgotten the details.
I only remember the German sitting by the road and muttering that he
wanted to be let alone, and the old tired mother-in-Poland saying the harsh
words and forcing her weary companions to march through the night back
into their own country.

<span class="firstchar">I</span> Zarathustra, declare myself! Ye have dulled me with priests;
ye have sweetened me with girls; ye have betrayed me with envious
anarchists.
</p>

<p>
Lo, I am not for the preacher, I am not for the woman, I am not for
the oppressed! Ye say that by me ye shall save the world; I say that I
shall destroy the world!
</p>

<p>
These things do I hold sacred—my strength, my lust, my joy. These
ye shall feed, and die.
</p>

<p>
Too long have I stood silent in the cackle of my followers. Poultry
after my corn! I have said, “Dost thou seek to multiply thyself? Find
ciphers!”
</p>

<p>
I will give you a new law:—Love your enemy, for him ye may destroy.
Fear your friend, for he shall steal your raiment.
</p>

<p>
Dost thou think that my aloofness is thy aloofness? Dost thou flutter
upon a ridgepole because I stand upon a mountain? Fool, thou shalt
starve unless thou peck the earth.
</p>

<p>
I say unto the preacher: Stick to the Nazarene; he hath deserved
his Golgotha. But who shall make my words a law for me?
</p>

<p>
I say unto the woman: My scourge is yet upon thee. Dost thou set
thyself against myself? I shall ravish thee when I desire thee. Who art
thou to pretend manhood? Submit or deny thy life. Serve, or go barren
into the earth.
</p>

<p>
I say unto the poor and lowly: I denied you my pity; now ye think
to rob me of my scorn. Paltry ones! Shall I deny myself because of
you? Lo, if I delight in riches, I shall take them. My life is not your
life; my children are not your children. Cry not at my oppression; ye
shall not move me. And if ye mock me with my own words, they shall
scorch your tongues; ye shall go to a blacker oppression, ye shall find
harder masters—yourselves!
</p>

<p>
And I say unto the priest, the woman, and the lowly: Touch me not;
ye are my enemies! I have declared myself, and ye have not known me.
I am life, I am splendor, I am eternity. Ye deny me as ye lay your hands
upon me. Remain afar off; then may I be in you. I will keep you slaves;
thus only shall I live.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">N</span><span class="postfirstchar">ietzsche</span> thought Wagner was the artist of decadence; Arthur Symons
thinks he was a unique genius. Nietzsche regarded him as the
great corrupter of music:—“he has made music sick”; Symons says that
to find a parallel for Wagner’s achievement we must look back to the
Greeks, to the age of Æschylus and Sophocles. Each one proved his point.
It’s a bit confusing, and you begin to wonder what Art is.
</p>

<p>
Have you ever found a definition of aesthetic values that will hold
through the whole art miracle? I never have and never expect to. Even
in Pater’s <em>The School of Giorgione</em> you are merely told that since all art
constantly aspires toward the condition of music, toward that perfect identification
of matter and form, the chief function of aesthetic criticism is
to estimate the degree in which all the arts approach to musical law. But
musical law is constantly changing; and the criterion of the degree to which
matter and form become identical will be a sort of sliding scale. And what
every one wants to know is how to gauge that scale. Can you think of a
single art judgment in the whole realm of aesthetics that you can use as an
infallible touchstone; with which you can make a mediocre poet realize
why his work is bad instead of good? You can make him realize, by the
desperate wildness with which you shriek “It’s not well done”, that something
is wrong; but to save your life you can’t convince him that you are
talking about anything except your own instinct—as you aren’t; and of
course he feels that his instinct may be just as good as yours—which of
course it can’t! Suppose you choose one of the best definitions ever thought
of,—Mérimée’s “all art is exaggeration <em>à propos</em>”; you find that you’re just
as badly off as before: by what standard is the <em>à propos</em> measured?
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="noindent">
It was in this frame of mind that I heard Leo Ornstein’s music. First
he came one night and played for us alone, on our Mason and Hamlin, in a
half light and an atmosphere of intense excitement. None of us had decided
beforehand that we should want to laugh or hiss or throw things at
him, as they did in London two years ago. We expected something beautiful
and we got it. He played his <em>Impressions of the Thames</em>, which he
afterward described as a river of “towers and turrets and stars, of dark
rushing water, of bridges and buildings, of desolate muddy banks, and
then something which you cannot bear to look at any longer.” I can’t “see”
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
music, so I only know that it was sound which interested and pleased and
shook me. Then he played his <em>Funeral March</em>, which had something dark
and vast in it; then some Ravel, the music of which interested me more
than his playing of it; and finally the Schumann <em>Arabesque</em>, which he did
so beautifully that I thought “Here is a man who plays just as he wants to,
and probably comes nearer to what Schumann would have liked than all
the strict interpreters with their flawless ‘taste’ have done.” It seemed to
me that Ornstein did what he did with it—stretched its slenderness to a
lovelier curve—in the interest of the piano; and that is the very best thing
anyone can do with written music for the piano, even if the pedagogues
can’t beat time to it.
</p>

<p>
So at the end I was beginning to think: perhaps this is the man who
is to bring to the piano that something it still needs.
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="noindent">
But the next morning, at his recital, I made an interesting discovery.
Ornstein has brought nothing to the piano. He has brought something to
the world of music: compositions which show that the piano music is more
pliable than we had thought, and interpretations which show an exaggeration
<em>à propos</em>. To the piano, as an instrument, he has brought what all the
others have brought: virtuosity—and in this case a not exceptional virtuosity.
This may sound like hair splitting, but it really is not.
</p>

<p>
Ornstein has done this: he has written some very interesting music,
and he plays it as most composers of talent—perhaps of genius—would play
their things if they had studied the piano as thoroughly as he. What is
there in this to cause hysterics? The fact that it sounds different from
the music you have been hearing? But that would seem to be a reason
for interest, not merely for mirth. This reaction belongs in the same plane
with patriotism and duty:—you laugh at what is strange, you love what is
familiar, you obey what has been tested:—the three ready-made emotions,
with which you can escape most effectively from art and life. So they
howled at Ornstein. Two respectable women sitting near me, who would
not have dared—what do I say? who would not have <em>been able</em>—to laugh
at a minister’s treatise on good and evil or a president’s speech on loyalty to
a flag, were so convulsed over Ornstein’s <em>Impressions of the Thames</em> that
they moved their seats to the rear of the theatre where they could not be
watched,—where they could merely disturb the pianist by their audible
snortings. The critics have done the same thing—laughed at Ornstein’s
own music and criticised scathingly his manner of playing familiar music.
Ornstein’s interest, I am sure, is chiefly in what he has to say, and second in
the way he says it. He is a composer-virtuoso. I had hoped he would be
a piano-lover. That is the kind of artist I am looking for with more interest
than I have for anything else in this world.
</p>

<p>
As for Ornstein himself, I think he is a sincere person who means to
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
go on doing his work. I sometimes judge the sensitiveness of a nature
by the intensity of expression that moves across the cheek-bones. You
might look carefully at Ornstein’s face instead of judging him by the fact
that his hair falls into his eyes when he plays. Of course he has been indiscreet
enough to mention that he does not like Beethoven. Why that is
unforgivable I can’t imagine. A man may surely like what he pleases. The
high genius of a Mozart or a Haydn is a thing he feels intensely. He admires
Chopin deeply as an artist who could do one thing very well and
was content to let it go at that. Grieg he thinks is not a worthy mouthpiece
for all that Norway has to give a musician. He loves Debussy, but thinks
that Ravel is the greater man: “Debussy stands beside a pond and tells
you beautifully of all he sees there; Ravel plunges into the pond and gives
you the life of it.” Stravinsky and Scriabine are the two he cares for
most, as I remember. “Schönberg has worked out his theory before he has
worked out his art.” Something of that sort might apply to Ornstein himself,
as in the case of his Chopin <em>Nocturne in E Flat</em>: I disliked his “exaggeration”
in it as much as anything I have ever heard on a piano.
</p>

Oh, does no one realize what the unique beauty of a piano is, and that
there are secrets of sound in it which have not yet been touched upon?

Letters from Prison

<p class="aut">
EMMA GOLDMAN
</p>

<p class="date">
<em>Queen’s County Jail,<br>
Long Island City, New York.<br>
April, 1916.</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hat</span> am I doing? I am watching human misery. There is no
misery so appalling as imprisoned misery. It is so helpless, so
humiliated.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I think the prisoners do love me, at least those who have been
thrown in with me. It is so easy to get their love. The least bit of kindness
moves them—they are so appreciative. But what can one do for
them?
</p>

<p>
Do you remember that passage from Galsworthy’s <em>Justice</em> in which
some one says to Falder: “No one wishes you harm”? Therein lies the
pathos. No one wishes these social victims harm. The Warden and Matron
here are exceptionally kind. And yet the harm, the irreparable harm, is
done by the very fact that human beings are locked up, robbed of their
identity, their self-respect, their self-hood.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I am not sorry I was sentenced. In fact I am glad. I needed to
get to these pariahs who are the butt of all the horrors. It would be well
if every rebel were sent to prison for a time; it would fan his smouldering
flame of hate of the things that make prisons possible. I am really
glad.
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="noindent">
... We are awakened at six and unlocked at seven in the morning.
Then comes breakfast, of which I have so far eaten only oatmeal with
what pretends to be milk. The coffee or tea I have not managed to get
down. At seven-thirty we are taken out into the yard. I walk up and
down like one possessed, to get the exercise. At eight-thirty we are back,
and the women keep themselves busy scribbling; but my girls will not let
me do that; I must talk to them. (The Warden, by the way, is reading
my <em>Anarchism</em>, and the Matron my <em>Social Significance of the Modern
Drama</em>). In fact, I seem to have more devotion here than on the outside.
At eleven we have dinner, and at four in the afternoon supper—which I
will describe to you when I come out. Then we are locked up until seven
A. M.—fifteen hours, the hardest of all to bear. Do you remember the
line in <em>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</em>: “Each day a year whose days grow
old”? To me it is “each night a year whose nights grow long”. I have
always loved the night, but jailed nights are ghastly things.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
The lights are on until nine P. M., and we can read and write all day—which
is a god-send. Also this prison is one of the cleanest in the country.
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="noindent">
... What on earth have I done that people should go into such
ecstasies? No one raves because you breathe; why rave if you take a
determined stand when that means the very breath of life to you? Really
I feel embarrassed with all the love and devotion and adulation for so
little a thing, so infinitesimal compared with the truly heroic deeds of the
great souls. My only consolation is that the fight is not at an end and
that I may yet be called upon to do something really great. But for the
present it is hardly worth the fuss.
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="noindent">
Today is Sunday and we were taken out to the yard for a walk. It
was a glorious day, marred only by the monotony of the stripes and the
spiritless slouching figures. Yet the sky excluded no one; its glorious blue
spread over them all, as if there were no sorrows in all the world and man
was never cruel to his kind.
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="noindent">
The days pass quickly between the study of my fellow prisoners, my
letters, and other writing. The evenings are taken up with reading. But
jailed nights are so oppressive. They lie like stone upon your heart. The
thoughts, the sobs, the moans that emerge like pale shadows from every
human soul. It is stifling. Yet people talk of hell. There is no more
threatening thing in all the world than the hell of jailed nights.
</p>

    <p class="verse">That calmed me some,</p>
    <p class="verse">An’ I commenced to think I’d better git him out</p>
    <p class="verse">From under them laylocks.</p>
    <p class="verse">I planned to drag him inter th’ barn</p>
    <p class="verse">An’ lock him in ther’ till Clarence come in th’ mornin’.</p>
    <p class="verse">I got so mad thinkin’ o’ that all-fired brazen tramp</p>
    <p class="verse">Asleep in my laylocks,</p>
    <p class="verse">I just stooped down and grabbed th’ hand and give it an awful pull.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then I bumped right down settin’ on the ground.</p>
    <p class="verse">Mis’ Priest, ther’ warn’t no body come with the hand.</p>
    <p class="verse">No, it ain’t cold, it’s jest that I can’t bear thinkin’ of it</p>
    <p class="verse">Ev’n now.</p>
    <p class="verse">I’ll take a sip o’ tea.</p>
    <p class="verse">Thank you, Mis’ Priest, that’s better.</p>
    <p class="verse">I’d ruther finish now I’ve begun.</p>
    <p class="verse">Thank you, jest the same.</p>
    <p class="verse">I dropped the hand’s ef it’d be’n red hot</p>
    <p class="verse">’Stead o’ ice cold.</p>
    <p class="verse">Fer a minit or two I jest laid on that grass</p>
    <p class="verse">Pantin’.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then I up and run to them laylocks</p>
    <p class="verse">An’ pulled ’em every which way.</p>
    <p class="verse">True as I’m settin’ here, Mis’ Priest,</p>
    <p class="verse">Ther’ warn’t nothin’ ther’.</p>
    <p class="verse">I peeked an’ pryed all about ’em,</p>
    <p class="verse">But ther’ warn’t no man ther’</p>
    <p class="verse">Neither livin’ nor dead.</p>
    <p class="verse">But the hand was ther’ all right,</p>
    <p class="verse">Upside down, the way I’d dropped it,</p>
    <p class="verse">And glist’ning fit to dazzle yer.</p>
    <p class="verse">I don’t know how I done it,</p>
    <p class="verse">And I don’t know why I done it,</p>
    <p class="verse">But I wanted to get that dre’tful hand out o’ sight.</p>
    <p class="verse">I got in t’ th’ barn, somehow,</p>
    <p class="verse">An’ felt roun’ till I got a spade.</p>
    <p class="verse">I couldn’t stop fer a lantern,</p>
    <p class="verse">Besides, the moonlight was bright enough in all conscience.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then I scooped that awful thing up in th’ spade.</p>
    <p class="verse">I had a sight o’ trouble doin’ it.</p>
    <p class="verse">It slid off, and tipped over, and I couldn’t bear</p>
    <p class="verse">Ev’n to touch it with my foot to prop it,</p>
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
    <p class="verse">But I done it somehow.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then I carried it off behind the barn,</p>
    <p class="verse">Clost to an old appletree</p>
    <p class="verse">Where you couldn’t see from the house,</p>
    <p class="verse">An’ I buried it,</p>
    <p class="verse">Good an’ deep.</p>
    <p class="verse">I don’t rec’lect nothin’ more o’ that night.</p>
    <p class="verse">Clarence woke me up in th’ mornin’,</p>
    <p class="verse">Hollerin’ for me to come down and set th’ milk.</p>
    <p class="verse">When he’d gone</p>
    <p class="verse">I stole roun’ to the appletree</p>
    <p class="verse">And seed the earth all newly turned</p>
    <p class="verse">Where I left it in my hurry.</p>
    <p class="verse">I did a heap o’ gardenin’</p>
    <p class="verse">That mornin’.</p>
    <p class="verse">I couldn’t cut no big sods</p>
    <p class="verse">Fear Clarence would notice and ask me what I wanted ’em fer,</p>
    <p class="verse">So I got teeny bits o’ turf here and ther,’</p>
    <p class="verse">And no one couldn’t tell ther’d be’n any diggin’</p>
    <p class="verse">When I got through.</p>
    <p class="verse">They was awful days after that, Mis’ Priest,</p>
    <p class="verse">I used ter go every mornin’ and poke about them bushes,</p>
    <p class="verse">And up and down the fence,</p>
    <p class="verse">Ter find the body that hand come off of.</p>
    <p class="verse">But I couldn’t never find nothin’.</p>
    <p class="verse">I’d lay awake nights</p>
    <p class="verse">Hearin’ them laylocks blowin’ and whiskin’.</p>
    <p class="verse">Finally I had Clarence cut ’em down</p>
    <p class="verse">An’ make a big bonfire of ’em.</p>
    <p class="verse">I told him the smell made me sick,</p>
    <p class="verse">An’ that warn’t no lie,</p>
    <p class="verse">I can’t a’ bear the smell on ’em now.</p>
    <p class="verse">An no wonder, es you say.</p>
    <p class="verse">I fretted somethin’ awful about that hand.</p>
    <p class="verse">I wondered could it be Hiram’s,</p>
    <p class="verse">But folks don’t rob graveyards hereabouts.</p>
    <p class="verse">Besides Hiram’s hands warn’t that awful, starin’ white.</p>

    <p class="verse">But that ain’t the worst, Mis’ Priest,</p>
    <p class="verse">Not by a long way.</p>

    <p class="verse">And I warn’t scared no more.</p>
    <p class="verse">Lived down my fear, I guess.</p>

    <p class="verse">I was foolhardy with the long time that had gone by.</p>

<span class="firstchar">I</span> am not here to harry institutions, to prod up mummies swathed in red
tape and embalmed in routine and respectability, nor am I here to bury
the unburied dead.
</p>

<p>
People say, “Why do you jump on the Art Institute for becoming a
trade school? It is only following the tendencies of the times. Art is
like everything else.” There you have it!—the whole trouble. There is
no consciousness of art, no consciousness that art is beyond all these things—that
it is as the sun to the earth, and if it were to fail us we should grow
like potatoes in a deep cellar.
</p>

<p>
It is only when art students say, “This is not what we sought. Where
shall we go, what shall we love, what do, to find what we sought?” that
the Art Institute is brought into it, and then only to serve as an example of
the lack of art consciousness everywhere, and to emphasize the fact that
the artist has no place in this land of wasteful virtues.
</p>

<p>
An artist almost disgraces the family into which he is born, he is pitied
a little by outsiders, he is left alone. At last, when he can stand it no
longer, he breaks the parent heart, and goes out full of high hope to find
his own kind and to keep his own faith. After a short time he finds the
art school very much like a factory; he learns to do his piece, when he had
thought to create a new beauty, and he finds, too, that he is still an outcast
for his beliefs and desires.
</p>

<p>
More than ninety-nine percent of the students who study art never
qualify as artists. We are all born into the world creators. In the interval
some wander into by-paths, play nicely upon the piano or violin, do art,
or write poetry. Maiden aunts and fond grandmas proclaim them geniuses,
all the time praying that they do not become artists. When love comes,
they leave the by-paths to fall into lock step on the old worn way.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
It is not what is accomplished on these journeys along the outposts
of art, but it is the experience that counts. If they have met there one
or two who stirred their senses with the impression of bearing a “fragile
and mighty thing,” who could rise above the earth and shout in a flamelight
of joy, or fall upon the earth and moan with the dark trouble of
Things; if they have caught from these a quickened sense of Life, and
learned a broader observation and consciousness of beauty; even though
they cannot create as the artist creates—still from this experience they
should feel the power to create a new life for those whom they in their
turn may meet. If they would so much as teach the children, not the old
formidable “Fear God and keep his commandments,” but rather

<p class="noindent">
we should grow a race with a deep desire for the “free, unsullied things
which never fail and never can decay.”
</p>

<p>
The Artist knows as surely as though he walked with God upon those
six days of creation that <em>this</em> He made and nothing more—but here He
made all. Other men fill in the gap between what they are and what they
feel they could be, what they long for and cannot find, what they attain and
aspire to, with Religion. Then, walled in with the belief of finding completion
in a future life, they live on unconscious of the passionate splendor
and ecstasy of this life. The artist, realizing that here we must live our
life and our immortality, cries out to men to know all, to feel all, to be all
here, and he strives with his whole soul, gives up his life to show men what
he has seen. But the turning of great wheels, the blasts of furnaces, and
the straining of millions of human beings that a few may be comfortable,
drown his voice. And because he does not take part in this great struggle
for physical contentment, does not live the cramped, dwarfed life of society,
there is no place for him in modern life. Even though the wisest seem
deceived, still the artist must believe that a consciousness of Art will come,
and that even the most stupid will sometime know that he must have Art
before bread.

(<em>The Poetry Society of America Meets and I Attend, Taking
with Me a Sense of Humor.</em>)
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> is, in this city, a Poetry Society. Once a month they gather
together at a handsome club to talk and be talked to. Once a year
they foregather at a grand hotel for a handsome dinner and some more
talk.
</p>

<p>
I am inquisitive, God help me! He and good training have made
me so. To gratify my curiosity concerning the makers of American
poetry, I asked Master Witter Bynner, one of their band, to take me to
their monthly meeting at the National Arts Club. I ache still from
suppressed laughter. (Dear sense of humor, what would I do without
you when I visit the habitations of the pretentious and the congregation
of the hum-bugs?)
</p>

<p>
It is the custom of this body of—of—the word I want will come to
me later. It is their custom, I say, to ask for unpublished verse to be
read aloud to the assemblage. The reader of the evening was Witter
Bynner. Now Mr Bynner is a poet with a fine, vibrant voice and a rare
appreciation for pause and effect, but when he read the verse of those
anonymous poets such feeling did he put into them that his legs quivered
and showed great emotion. That distressed and distracted me.
</p>

<p>
After each poem was read it was criticized by the audience. Criticism
of a certain type is the easiest thing in the world. That type, that
petty, empty, wordy type, was present in all its glory. Its chief exponent
was one Shaemas O’Sheel, a wordy fellow loving the sound of
his own voice and giving vent to many empty phrases with much gusto
and argumentative fervor. Mr O’Sheel once wrote and had published
in a book this plaintive thing:
</p>

      <p class="verse">It is not loud; it is not long,</p>
      <p class="verse">And wherefor should I sing?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Echo answers, Wherefor?

<p>
Another fellow who fancied himself as critic was a youth named
Joyce Kilmer. Perhaps you have heard of him. He is the author of
charming conceits, in verse, on trees and delicatessen stores. He has
also written some sweet roundels and ballades. Incidentally he is a
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
member of the staff of <em>The New York Times</em>. Occasionally he makes
excursions to Women’s Clubs and other intellectual organizations to tell
them all he knows about poetry. God save him! And God save me
from ever hearing another night of such criticism from ponderous
youths and knowing old maids!
</p>

<p>
After the reading of the poems, and the stupid remarks that followed
the reading, there came what was called the “social intermission”.
During this time insipid punch and silly little biscuits were served to as
many of the mob as could grab them, and a noise as of a host of parrots
in a small place filled the room. (Curious what bad punch will do to
good, respectable people!) Following the excitement of the jabber and
the near-wine the audience settled down to be sobered up by the reading
of two seeming epics by Cale Young Rice. Mr Rice is dull—oh, very
dull he is. Not only so, but his verse is—I won’t say; and he reads it
with the voice of the spirit of a one-time virtuous Methodist minister
chanting a prayer in the coolest part of Hell.
</p>

<p>
So he read his dreary interminable poems. So I had visions of
all the precious Sundays my Presbyterian parents had forced me to
waste. That vision passed and I still heard the whining drone. Back
to my mind again where I had vicious thoughts of the tortures I would
like to play upon bad poets who write bad verse and read it with bad
accent and bad voice to good harmless people. By the time I had thought
out and perfected a most amazing and subtle form of torture for such
disturbers of human happiness, the dismal noise had stopped. Some
day....
</p>

<p>
After the effort of the Rice man, Laurence Houseman read some of
his fanciful poems. They were welcome. A Spring wind among the reeds
after a prolonged dull thaw.
</p>

<p>
Poetry flourishes in America.
</p>

<p>
The poets are paid well by the Magazines; and strange women dine
and wine them and pay them sweet homage.
</p>

<p>
The majority own and sport dress suits. They are eminently decent
and respectable.
</p>

<p>
Poetry readings are now a well-attended form of afternoon time-killing.

The stops are in. The organ is closed. For forty years it has “discoursed
much excellent sweet music.” Now the organist is weary, and
would fain rest. He has played many things and played them well. A
gentle sweet melody like <em>Mice and Men</em> was made more sweet by his
playing; and even if he did sometimes play a popular tune like <em>The Third
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
Floor Back</em> were we not the more thrilled and moved when we heard the
beauty of his playing of the symphony of <em>Hamlet</em>?
</p>

<p>
On Saturday, April 22, I watched, now from the wings, now from
a side box, the last public performance of this artist’s <em>Hamlet</em>. Oh that
I could write as well as I feel; that my words had the strength and the
bursting keenness of my emotions. Then might I tell something.
</p>

<p>
Have you seen the sudden brilliant leap of a flame sometimes before
it finally goes out? There was the same sort of spurt in that past performance.
I had seen Robertson play Hamlet a year ago; in Brooklyn
a week before I had watched him wearily play his part, and by the comparison
I understood the effort involved in the brilliancy of his playing
that day. There was a heart-bursting poignancy about his swan song.
I cried with the Queen: “Oh Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!”
And when at the end of it all he sat there on the throne of Denmark with
that unforgettable look, purged from all the suffering and weariness; and
when they bore him off to the music of Tchaikovsky’s <em>Dead March</em>, what
could a feeling mortal do but—but—I cannot tell what I did.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> question is being asked, re-asked and debated, What is Imagism?
The fact that this question is constantly raised anew proves that it
is not an academic one. For if we are to see clearly the underlying principles
of the new poetry, and to understand the relationship of the group
which call themselves the Imagists to those principles, we must first
disassociate Imagism, strictly speaking, from all that body of verse now
being produced in the free-verse forms. As a critic not long ago pointed
out, vers libre and Imagism are not to be confused. Vers libre can be produced
and has been produced which is not Imagistic, but realistic, symbolistic,
or merely dull. Imagism is an attitude of mind which can appear just
as well under the guise of metre and rhyme, or prose, as in verse itself.
What, then, is Imagism?
</p>

<p>
Briefly, the doctrine we call Imagism has four cardinal points or principles.
The first of these concerns presentation of the subject. The
Imagist aims to present his subject as an image; that is to say, he presents
the sum-total of the emotions in any given subject in such a way that the
reader experiences the self-same emotions from them. To do this it is
necessary for the Imagist to regard his subject-matter from its most
imaginative aspect, and to present it visually. For the reader, not having
experienced the emotion which moved the author to create his poem, is
incapable of grasping that emotion save through a direct and complete
appeal to his imagination through his higher senses of sight and hearing.
By stimulating these senses, through appropriate choice of words, the
Imagist aims to arouse the reader to such a pitch that the reader re-creates
imaginatively for himself the emotional complex which gave birth to the
poem. Imagism is, therefore, first of all a means of arousing the emotions
through the imagination. The Imagists must therefore be sharply distinguished
from the realistic school, and also from the symbolists of the nineteenth
century, from which latter they have, in some sense, derived.
Through the constant insistence on emotion as the underlying essence of
poetry, the Imagists approach closely to the Elizabethans of the sixteenth
and the early romantics of the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
The second principle of Imagism concerns style. The Imagists desire
to accomplish that renovation of the English language which is always
periodically necessary if good poetry is to continue to be created in it. The
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
Imagists have certain prejudices against inversions, clichés, journalese, highfalutin
bombast, literary jargon, messy padding with adjectives. Each
word must be an exact word, that is to say the sole word necessary for its
particular place and purpose in the poem. This careful consideration for
style relates the Imagists to the classicists of the eighteenth century, who
undoubtedly rescued the English language from the absurdities of the
“metaphysical” school. The Imagists also insist on it as a useful check to
too great an exuberance of imagination.
</p>

<p>
The third principle of Imagism concerns form. The rhythmical form
of the poem should not be a mere empty pattern, but should follow, as far
as possible, the ebb and flow of the emotion throughout the poem. It should
be an integral part of the poem itself, as indissoluble from it as the substance
of the words themselves. Therefore the Imagists hold that the theory
and practice of vers libre is necessary, although they do not go so far as to
demand it in every case, or to say that rhyme and metre have not their
uses. In their desire to create a full emotional range of rhythmical
nuances, inclusive of both rhyme and metre as well as freer rhythmical
figures, the Imagists derive direct from the first great romantic poets of
England—Blake and Coleridge.
</p>

<p>
The last principle of Imagism concerns the attitude of the artist to life.
The artist should realize that if he is not to be the slave of life he must not
attempt to be its judge. He must not obtrude his petty personal judgments
and vanities between the reader and the subject he writes about. He must
not, in short, moralise about life, or gush over it, or make others feel anything
else except what he has felt about it. In this respect the Imagist
poets are in very firm reaction against the sentimental and pious optimism
of the mid-nineteenth century, against the equally sentimental and fallacious
aestheticism of the eighties and nineties, and—it may be added—against
a good deal of the wishy-washy suggestiveness and sex-obsession
that seems to be getting the upper hand of so many writers of today. The
Imagist does not weight the balance, either for “morality” or “immorality”:
he states, and lets the reader draw his own conclusion.
</p>

<p>
With these four principles in mind, we may now ask ourselves how the
Imagists have carried them into practice. For practice is, after all, the
supreme test of any theory of art. There are signs that Imagism is getting
itself taken more seriously, not as a mere passing fad, but as something
that has at least established certain guide-posts and land-marks for future
poets, who wish to renew the traditions of good writing. I maintain that
it has done more. It has permitted three poets, at least, to start from the
same principles and to produce among them a very respectable body of
poetry, which in each case is filled with the individual flavour of the personality
who wrote it. That the Imagist principles should display such
applicability and elasticity is, I maintain, very remarkable. We shall now
see who these three poets are.

<p class="noindent">
Mr Richard Aldington, the first of the three to be considered, has
recently brought together some thirty of his poems in a small volume,
entitled <em>Images</em>. That this selection does not represent all of Mr Aldington’s
work, must be apparent to all who are familiar with it. His long
poem, <em>Childhood</em>, is not here; nor is his other long poem on the war, which
surely deserves mention as being one of the few really humorous war poems
ever written. To come to the shorter pieces, surely all admirers of Mr
Aldington’s talent must deplore the absence of <em>Daisy</em>, <em>Round Pond</em> and <em>The
Poplar</em>—the latter one of the most beautiful poems he has ever written.
But whether Mr Aldington has omitted these pieces from a too severe
critical judgment, or whether because they seem to interfere with the unity
of his book, the fact remains that they were omitted, but that enough is
left to give nearly all sides of his achievement.
</p>

<p>
Mr Aldington is a sophisticated, a cultivated, even a bookish poet. He
has translated Anyte of Tegea, the Latin Poets of the Renaissance, and
even that astounding farrago of poetry and buffoonery called Les Chansons
de Maldoror. Recently he has given us, in the columns of <em>The Egoist</em>, a
glimpse at his library which ranges from Euripides, via Apuleius, Hooker
and Crowley, to Ford Madox Hueffer! “And is it for this I have
laboured?” he cries. “To be the object of derision of some bibliophile looking
at his books as cynically and disgustedly as I look at mine?”
</p>

<p>
No, it is not for this. It is for a handful of strange and satisfying
poems that Mr Aldington has laboured. Every artist knows that it takes
a great deal of life, an immense amount of experience and appreciation, to
make even a little art. Life is like a many-faceted prism. We must walk
around it, observe it on every side, see it not as we ourselves would care to
see it, but as others have seen it, before we can induce it to show a new
side to our efforts, to cast a few rays which it has not already cast before.
Matthew Arnold, who was one of the few English critics able to look at
literature from the standpoint of its historical development, declared that
poetry was a criticism of life. And so it is. The task of a modern poet
is not to shut his eyes to the past, but to see the work of the generations
that preceded him as an uncompleted structure, the living intention of whose
builders is again born in him, and seeks fruition in the additions he can
make to it. In this sense Mr Aldington is a modern poet. He is a poet
for the well-read, intelligent, cultivated man or woman.
</p>

<p>
The first poem of his I can remember seeing in print was the one
entitled <em>Choricos</em>:

      <p class="verse">Comes gently upon us.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
There is nothing in all the literature I know which can be safely set
beside this poem (of which I have only quoted a few fragments) except a
few lines of Leopardi:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">In te, Morte, si pose</p>
      <p class="verse">Nostra ignuda natura;</p>
      <p class="verse">Lieto, no, ma sicura</p>
      <p class="verse">Del antico dolor.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Other than that, it is unique. And since it is the fashion to despise a
poet because he does not write of aeroplanes and locomotives and socialism,
but of the eternal verities of life, death, beauty, irony, let us first of all
brush away the shallow assumption that Mr Aldington is an imitator of
the classics and that all his work seems a derivation from the Greek.
</p>

<p>
The mood of the poem from which I have just quoted is not a mood
which can be found in any Greek poet, or which any Greek would ever
have understood. I have quoted enough to show what that mood is. It is
a mood of mutability, of the sadness that arises in us when we see the instability
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
of all earthly things. The first Occidental poet who ever expressed
this mood, to my knowledge, was François Villon. In the East, of course,
it was felt and expressed much earlier. For one must have seen kingdoms
pass away and empires crumble to the dust and “the owl sing his watch-song
from the towers of Afrasiab” before one can feel this mood, which
Mr Aldington has here so beautifully and poignantly expressed.
</p>

<p>
Throughout his poetry Mr Aldington has frequently given us this
emotion of a civilized man, a modern, brought face to face with some beautiful
fragment of the past. Thus he cries to a Greek marble:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">I am thy brother,</p>
      <p class="verse">Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,</p>
      <p class="verse">And thou hearest me not.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Surely no one would contend that a Greek could ever have said this!
And in some quite recent poems we have the same feeling applied to the
Renaissance, and even to modernity:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

Such a poet is not what we vulgarly choose to call an optimist. No!
Let us admit once for all, Mr Aldington is a pessimist. (So, by the way,
were Sophocles and Leopardi and Shakespeare when he wrote <em>King Lear</em>,
and Mr Thomas Hardy, to mention only a few; but I have never heard
they were worse poets for it.) At times he gives us a very bitter dose
indeed to swallow, as in his <em>Childhood</em>, <em>Cinema Exit</em>, or <em>In the Tube</em>. Yet
he is not devoid of humour, playful and fantastic. Witness <em>The Faun Sees
Snow for the First Time</em>, the <em>Interlude</em>, the <em>Evening</em> (a beautiful grotesque
which I am tempted to quote), or for a grimmer note the conclusion of
<em>Lesbia</em>. He will not admit that life is altogether without compensations.
Herein he is honest. He even admits sentiment as a compensation, and
he treats it delicately, fastidiously, with an unexpected touch of purely fourteenth-century
feeling in the following piece:

Altogether an unusual poet. One who never takes up the pen except
when he has something individual to say, and whose utterance is at times
so varied as to make him almost bafflingly individual. But not a Greek,
although he has written finely on Greek themes. A modern? Yes; and not
only a modern but, au fond, a Romantic. Remember the conclusion of the
beautiful <em>Night Piece</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

“Very faint and shrill and far away the whistle sounds—more like a
wild bird than ever. And all my unsatisfied desires and empty wishes and

of the Coach of Romance.”

<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> is still on—the Russian invasion.

<p>
Across the ocean the triumphant Prussian drives a hedge into the
heart of Russia. With blood and iron and fire Efficiency celebrates its
victory over Nihilism.
</p>

<p>
And we, the neutrals, the note-writers, attempt to thwart the grand
march of Efficiency by delivering shells to the port of Vladivostok. Shells
that do not always explode, despite their “moderate” prices.
</p>

<p>
In exchange we are getting thoughts, ideas. Unobstructed by Krupps
or U’s or Zeppelins, they invade our peaceful shores, and intend to stay.
</p>

<p>
Woe to the Chambers and Herricks and Pooles and Dreisers and
McCutcheons and other best sellers! The enemy is raining in torrents, in
avalanches. What if the good, good public will be forced to taste the new
food. What if after having tasted it they will rebel and demand real
meat thereafter, rejecting as indigestible the canned affairs and the oleomargarine
surrogates. What if....
</p>

<p>
No danger, I am assured by my friend who has great faith in the
uncorruptible taste of the American public.
</p>

<p>
Surely no one will accuse the American publishers of being pure
idealists or Ford-like fanatics who are ready to squander their hard dollars
for propaganda purposes. Surely those gentlemen know their market and
adjust the supply to the demand. The extraordinary deluge of Russian
literature is evidently a paying proposition.
</p>

<p>
It is gratifying. We need the injection of new blood into our anemic
literature.
</p>

<p>
New blood. Not even Gogol is too old for us. No matter that he
died in 1852. His <em>Dead Souls</em>, <em>Tarass Bulba</em>, and just published stories<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a>
belong to the category of works that do not age in spite of their technical
flaws. If you use this perspective, <em>The Mantle</em> will loom up as the peak
of Russian realism. “We have all come out of <em>The Mantle</em>”, admitted
Gogol’s disciple, Dostoevsky. If in that tale we recognize the forerunner
of the relentless soul-vivisectionists of the later days, we get in the other
stories a glimpse of the mystic Gogol, the poet of Goyaesque witches and
devils. Do not read <em>Viy</em> before bed-time lest you go through a heavy
nightmare.
</p>

<p>
It is an enormous leap from Gogol to Korolenko<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-3" id="fnote-3">[3]</a>, Gorky<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-4" id="fnote-4">[4]</a>, and
Kuprin<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-5" id="fnote-5">[5]</a>. These are living authors, although they belong rather to the
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
past century in their motives and modes. Vladimir Korolenko is a writer
whose very name causes the heart of every Russian to beat with emotion.
Not for the greatness of his art: as an artist he ranks among the lesser.
It is the charm of his personality that places him far above all his colleagues.
His long years of exile in Siberia, his never-flagging championship of the
oppressed classes and races, his tireless encouragement of the young
beginners, and his smile, the deep, broad smile that flows like a sunny
stream through his writings, have endeared him to his countrymen beyond
parallel. Korolenko is the bridge between the heroic, idealistic seventies
and the ultra-individualistic moderns. His stories are not idylls, yet they
smile; he deals with tragedies, describes horrifying situations, but he bears
no ill feeling for the universe, he loves it with all its evils and follies, loves
it with that keen understanding which spells forgiveness. Gorky tells
us that he owes to Korolenko not only his discovery and introduction to
the public, but also his style. I seldom trust an author’s self-criticism.
Gorky differs from his alleged teacher in his style as well as in his
philosophy. Korolenko is gentle, mild, refined, loving, forgiving. Gorky
is rude, loud, hating, revenging. Both have known misery and hardships,
both have rubbed shoulders with the humiliated and down-trodden. But
Korolenko came out of the crucible with a radiant smile, with universal
compassion and sympathy. Gorky neither forgets or forgives. His body
and soul shriek out vengeance for man enslaved, maimed, bestialized. Korolenko
and his “disciple” both exalt human personality, but the first does
so indiscriminatingly, wholesalely, while Gorky glorifies only the strong,
proclaims the “beauty of power”, and scorns the weak worms, the lazy
adders who are content to stagnate in the mire. Gorky’s philosophy may
appeal to us who have drunk from the waters of Zarathustra, but Korolenko’s
art is purer, free from preaching, and hence more convincing.
</p>

<p>
Alexander Kuprin has been hailed as an anarchist, a free-love preacher,
a social reformer, a cynic, a retrograde, and what not. He may be all
these, or none, or more. Of all the Russian writers he is the only true,
unaffected Dionysian. His love for women, for wine, for horses, for
nature—in a word, for life, is spontaneous and elemental. None of the
hectic morbidity of the consumptive Artzibashev. Kuprin is a healthy
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
artist with an enormous eye. He sees to the bottom the mind of man and
animal, of the thief and the intellectual, of the empty military officer and
of the street-woman, of the artist and of the gambler, and he makes us
see what he sees with a cheerful gracefulness, with no other purpose but
the presentation of his sweetheart, life. His novel, <em>The Duel</em>, stirred
Russian society as a vigorous indictment of militarism, a picture of the
dehumanizing garrison life. Kuprin guffawed at that accusation over
a glass of vodka, as he is usually drawn by cartoonists. Far be it from
him to advocate or condemn. He rejoices in all his heroes, whether they
be garrison dummies, or artistic pickpockets (<em>The Outrage</em>), or Japanese
spies (<em>Captain Ribnikov</em>), or petty philistines (<em>The River of Life</em>). He
floats upon the “river of life”, observes, absorbs, delights, and chuckles
at the very fact of his existence. “Even if I were to fall under a railway
train, and were left lying on the line with broken and bleeding limbs, and
any one were to ask me if life were beautiful, I should none the less,
and even by summoning my last remains of strength, answer enthusiastically,
‘Ah, yes, even now life is glorious!’” (<em>The Duel</em>).
</p>

<p>
From the charming, lithe, joyous Kuprin I pass reluctantly to a book
on the lugubrious “cruel genius”, Dostoevsky<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-6" id="fnote-6">[6]</a>. It is deplorable that the
publisher who has given us the excellent translation of Dostoevsky by Constance
Garnett should throw on the market such a mediocrity as Mr.
Soloviev’s work, as if there were not excellent books on the novelist written
by Merezhkovsky, Volynsky, Vladimir Solovyov, Veresayev! Mr. Soloviev
presents the accepted view of Dostoevsky as the preacher of repentance
and atonement, the retrograde, the pillar of church and autocracy. Superficially,
the view appears to be correct. Dig deeper into the chaotic, epileptical
soul of the author of <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, gaze into the abysses
of the dual characters of Raskolnikov, Prince Myshkin, Stavrogin, Svidrigailov,
the Karamazovs, fling your imagination into the hellish crater of
the novelist’s mind, and Mr. Soloviev’s symmetrical structure evaporates
like mist. Again I ask, Why are such useless school-exercises reproduced
by intelligent publishers? Why should such a fine translator as Mr.
Hogarth waste his energy on puerilities?
</p>

<p>
The same Whys can be applied to another recent publication<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-7" id="fnote-7">[7]</a>, Doroshevich’s
impressions. Doroshevich is the most popular journalist in
Russia, a witty, entertaining <em>feuilletonist</em>, who employs an original staccato
rhythm. But there is no reason under the sun to translate his reportorial
impressions of the war fugitives, written for a Moscow daily paper. Their
value is purely local. How can we be interested in the management of the
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
Russian relief-points, or their mismanagement? True, at times Doroshevich
flashes brilliant impressionistic colors, as in describing the fugitives’
bonfires in the forest. But the rare gems do not justify the journalistic
heap.
</p>

<p>
I am uneasy about these fallacies of the publishers. Few though they
are, they may serve the part of a spoonful of vinegar in a pot of honey.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> rich aunt with whose aid the Chicago Society of Artists has
managed, up to the present, to check all artistic impulses in this
city, has lost her magic attraction and power. Her golden smiles and
soft pillows have failed lately to captivate and hold. There is a new
breed of young artists. They seem to be an energetic lot, and decline to
live in the future of promises; and, what is more horrible, they decline
to flirt with the rich aunt through the aid of the honorable society.
</p>

<p>
For many years she was the bubbling liquid within the life-giving
bottle. The magic corkscrew was in the safe, the combination known to
the initiated few. According to these few, young artists had to go through
a certain process of taming and self-effacement before they were gradually
given the secret. A certain amount of artistic ignorance plus an ability
to pull strings was required of every aspirant. A soft backbone bent by
many kicks was also one of the main requirements. “Don’t knock, you’ll
break the magic bottle” was their watchword. If you dared to ask questions
concerning the sacred duty of the initiated few, you aroused a hatred
that took years to melt,—a hatred that seemed impossible in such delicate
souls. The few artists who refused to be tamed left the city and
have settled in other parts.
</p>

<p>
And the philanthropic aunt, like all true philanthropists, acquired all
she could get and paid the minimum price. The paying was usually accompanied
by a lot of pompous actions and was supposed to be received
like a first-class iron cross by a common soldier. You see, the young talented
artist was actually compelled to bribe the art patron to get to the secret
of the combination, and was compelled to listen to all kinds of insults
besides. Here are a favorite few: “I have discovered him”; “I helped
him to get where he is now”; “If it were not for me....” The artist
was also used as a rare orchid at their dinner tables and as Chinese embroidery
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
at unusual occasions. I know one of these patrons who even resorted
to threats, when a young and independent sculptor refused to be “discovered.”
And such creatures pose as art patrons and connoisseurs, and
hold the combination to the life-giving bottle of this city.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, almost all the prestige and almost all the artistic
knowledge possessed by these same patrons was given them by their so-called
protegees at starvation prices. However, the patrons are hardly
to be blamed for this state of affairs. They were made by well-meaning
but mediocre artists whose highest ambitions were foggy imitations of a
certain kind of realism practiced abroad when my grandmother’s dolls
used up most of her time. The saddest or funniest side of this spectacle
is that the patrons have, for the last few years, advanced in understanding
beyond the possibilities of the artists who have made them. As you
can easily see, a most discouraging and impossible state of affairs. It
reached its climax at the last Chicago Artists’ exhibition, when those in
control, to use a popular saying, rubbed it in. It was a show of the aged
and crippled, and prizes were awarded on the basis of an Old-Age Benefit.
It was a slow sickness and positive in retarding all artistic endeavor in
this city.
</p>

<p>
But like a clear and promising path in this dark jungle comes the
first International Exhibition of Independent Artists. It is a jury-free exhibition,
and every man is allowed to hang two paintings, provided he pays
for the space. And it was a strong indictment against the old order. It
showed how thoroughly it has managed to kill all originality and individuality
in the younger artists. In spite of the fact that it was a jury-free
exhibition you could easily see that almost everyone had painted with
this little thought in the back of his head: This must please Messrs. Albright,
Juergens, and Company. To pick out the few who made a good
showing this time would be unfair to the rest. The whole show was conceived
and arranged in six weeks, and to me it was more interesting and
held more promise than any other show held in this city.
</p>

<p>
It is a young oak whose knotty branches, like playful fists, shoot in
unexpected directions. It grows up near a grey solemn mausoleum. The
mausoleum acts as if it does not notice the sturdy youngster; but it knows
in its heart, if it has one, that it will soon be hidden in the shadow of
this tree’s branches. Virile roots will crack the walls and decay will be
the deserved fate.

<em>SHE IS NO FRIEND OF OURS!</em>

<em>Arthur Davison Ficke, Davenport, Iowa</em>:
</p>

<p>
Will you be so kind as to ask your friend, “Virginia York”, to refrain from
re-misprinting for a third time, a bit hacked from my <em>Café Sketches</em>? If she finds
the poem so interesting, why does she not print it in its entirety, and correctly?
Then perhaps her readers could decide just where the joke lies—in the light of
“Virginia York’s” Olympian pronouncement that “maybe you think this is funny,
but certainly it is not intended to be.” Just because a little learning would be
dangerous for her, I shall never disclose to her what the poem <em>was</em> intended to be.
Besides, she wouldn’t believe me; for her, a thing has to be either <em>Lear</em> or <em>Charley’s
Aunt</em>, evidently.
</p>

<p>
I have harbored doubts as to the value of <em>vers libre</em>; but now they are gone.
For I see that it does shut out a certain type of mind.
</p>

<p>
Harriet Dean’s <em>Pillar</em> is admirable! Also Sandburg’s four.
</p>

<p>
Tell your “sixteen year old boy” that his poem is damn interesting—but to cut
out the “only sixteen” and “one could not expect me to know much about poetry”
stuff. At sixteen most of us had read all the poetry in existence, and were busy
writing epics that were to re-make the world. Tell him to stop being a sixteen-year-old
worm, and to get up on his hind legs and bite the stars. Tell him to
write arrogantly of this “charming” world he sees. It’s time enough to be humble
when one is old.

<em>THE PROPHET IN HIS OWN COUNTRY.</em>

<p class="from">
<em>Daphne and Michael Carr, Columbia, Missouri</em>:
</p>

<p>
We have been greatly enraged by reading Mr Charles Zwaska’s article, <em>An Isaiah
without a Christ</em>, in the April number of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. It reminds us of a
review of the same book in <em>Judge</em>. It ran something like this: “Vachel Lindsey
has out a new book on the Art of the Moving Picture. It might be all right,
but for the fact that the movie can never be Art.” In just the same sententious
way Mr Zwaska seems to be peeved that Lindsay should suggest the possibility of
art in a thing which is at present clumsily done. Some one has said that when
Miriam led the women of Israel to a dance of rejoicing, all of the women who
were too fat or too stiff to dance stood back and deplored the immodesty of their
nimble sisters. Perhaps Mr Zwaska is too fat, or too stiff, or too old. I don’t
know: may be he is so young that he still creeps and doesn’t think of dancing.
For Lindsay has sung out humanly and delightfully a more acceptable ideal of
democracy than any American has yet sung. The rest of us would-be artists are
creating things that can appeal to a small number. Lindsay is chanting to all
America, and all America is listening—we, the artists, as well as the littlest country
school-boy.

  </div>
<p class="noindent">
We shout it when the fire-engines fly down the street. We croon the moon
poems together in the evenings, and we chant <em>The Santa Fé Trail</em> as we tramp
across country.
</p>

<p>
Mr Zwaska seems to catch a glimmering of the fact that Lindsay is a rhyming
poet, because he is singing to all the people. Why does he not apply this a little
farther? Lindsay’s message, as I catch it, is this:
</p>

<p>
The Moving Picture has in it possibilities of a great art. Furthermore, it is
for all America, for every farm boy, for every little dish-washer as well as for
every millionaire. Let us make this art as perfect, as inspiring, as possible, since
it has a wider influence, be it good, bad, or indifferent, than any other art in the
history of humanity. The exquisite Parthenon, Sophocles’s tragedies performed in
the theater of Dionysus, were for the Athenians, and for such as could reach
Athens. Fortunately, that included a large percentage of the Greeks. But how
many Americans, proportionately, can see such wonders as New York has to offer?
</p>

<p>
When a moving-picture as perfect as the Parthenon has been produced there
need be no soul in America who has not seen it.
</p>

<p>
This being the ideal, we proceed toward its realization. Lindsay points out
some means of attaining beauty in the moving-pictures. The producers can, he
says, learn from the painters beauties of composition, of symbolism, of mood. Beautiful
sculpture can teach the rhythm, the speed, the grace of motion. And architecture
will help to interpret big social emotions, such as patriotism and religion in
terms of crowds, pageantlike, of landscapes, and, upon occasion, of architecture
itself.
</p>

<p>
But here Mr Zwaska objects. He says that Lindsay is making the moving-picture
a parasite on the other arts. I am not going to quote Noah Webster, or
Dr Johnson, but it is generally understood that a parasite is an organism that steals
its life from its host, weakening the host thereby. Has Mr Lorado Taft, or Mr
Frank Lloyd Wright, or Mr Jerome Blum, been robbed of any tittle of artistic ideas,
or of artistic technique, or of admiration by Lindsay’s book, or by the producers
who have tried so ineffectually to follow his suggestions? I don’t want to quibble
with metaphors, but if horticulture is to be the basis of them I should rather say that
Lindsay proposes to burbank a wonderful new nectarine art by crossing painting,
sculpture, architecture, and pantomime.
</p>

<p>
At present the difficulty is that there is no one in the producing field with the
artistic training, and feeling, and the burning genius withal to produce a wonderful
film. Max Reinhardt or Gordon Craig could do it, but even they would be working
against the difficulties of a new medium. D’Annunzio did pretty well with <em>Cabiria</em>
but——Have you ever read Aeschylus’ <em>Suppliants</em>? It was the first and afterwards
came <em>Electra</em> and <em>Œdipus</em>.
</p>

<p>
Well, along in his article Mr Zwaska grows boisterous at Lindsay who has, supposedly
working on a suggestion from his friend, James Oppenheim, spoken of the
possibility of a highly symbolic film production of <em>The Book of the Dead</em>. And
this because Mrs Moore of Chicago, has worked out beautiful dances, and costumes
and libretto for a stage production of the wonderful Nile and Sun myth. Bless
Mrs Lou Wall Moore! We love her and her devotion. We have been wonder-struck
by the loveliness of her Egyptian costume designs. When she does produce
<em>The Book of the Dead</em> we will, Fate permitting, make a pilgrimage from this movie-ridden
Missouri town to see it wherever it may he. And I know that we will be rejoiced
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
to be able to do so. But I am sure that dear Mrs Moore would be the last
person to object to a film production of <em>The Book of the Dead</em>, <em>IF</em> the production
be a beautiful one. For, as Lindsay iterates and reiterates, the stage and the moving-pictures
<em>MUST</em> be different. Mrs Moore’s production will have “the splendor
of color, space, height, distance, and most magical of all, the voice.” And the
worthy moving-picture production, when it arrives, will have, in black-and-white
symphony, the infinite depths of the sky, waving palm branches, the width of the
desert, and above all, beautifully controlled actors, streaming hundreds, directed and
co-ordinated as was the Diaghileff corps-de-ballet. And this beauty will travel all
over the country, touching, among others, this drama-starved town of Missouri,
where we suffer for want of visual beauty.
</p>

<p>
Mr Zwaska deplores the lack of composition—“moving lines” he calls it—in
the moving pictures. He says that he has seen it “only in the flight of gulls (unconscious
actors) or in pictures of rivers and trees, and the sea; in short—Nature.
But Nature is Nature” wailed Mr Zwaska. And pray, why pervert the facts you
bring forth? If the cinematograph can record the beautiful motion of the birds,
can it not equally well record the beautiful motion of humans when the producer
has learned to direct his actors as M. Fokine directs his dancers? <em>There</em> is room
for Art.
</p>

<p>
Why—why, in the name of all that is lovely, must people howl at any expression
of belief in possibilities of a new art? The moving-picture is Shakespearean,
Hugoesque, Zolaesque, in its method. We see through it not only Antony and
Cleopatra, but the two great hungry struggling groups that each impersonates. We
see not only the typical coal-miner and his typical sorrows; we see the mass of
his comrades under the same oppression, the same evil conditions. We see better,
because more swiftly, than Hugo could paint it with his wonderful vocabulary,
Notre Dame de Paris, the symbol, the social motif which embodies in a unity all
that the story tries to show of the beauty, the horror, the fate, and the aspirations
of the pre-Renaissance, an ever-present condition behind the actors. Are such possibilities
to be shoved aside and denied a place among the arts where pageantry
is admitted? Is the fact that thousands of bad, atrociously bad, films are turned
out to discredit the few well-constructed, symbolic film-plays? Look at our abominable
American poster-makers. Does this discredit Mr Blum, whose praises we hear
sung?
</p>

<p>
There is one really vital criticism in Mr Zwaska’s hectic article. That is, upon
Lindsay’s “too ruthless a theory” of no music in the movie theater. From the
first we shied at that. We are surprised at the author of poems to be read aloud.
Another of our admirable countrymen, who qualifies not only as a sociologist,
but as a philosopher and a poet, has his say on the subject quite incidentally. I
speak of Max Eastman, who, in his <em>Enjoyment of Poetry</em>, says, “I have yet to
find one in which the reality of the pictures is not enhanced with the beating of
an old piano. Nobody notices the piano, nobody remembers what the piano plays,
or how badly, but there it is, always keeping up a metre.” The audiences’ “voluntary
mind is on the canvas but the music slips all the deeper into their beings, and
it makes them live the pictures.” I can well believe Mr Zwaska’s account of the
after-midnight picture show. Granted that most picture-show music is terrible,
that the electric piano is agonizing, that it is deeply shocking to hear the <em>Miserere</em>
when sweet Mary Pickford is acting the Un Bel Di Vedremo scene in Butterfly,
the music is far less dreadful than silence, and we talk through it all the same. I
do not know a possible remedy, but it is worth the thought of every person interested
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
or disgusted. This is merely one of Vachel Lindsay’s acknowledged “paw
paws.”
</p>

<p>
So here we are at the end of our wrath. And here’s a cheer and a hearty
greeting for Lindsay, who is scaling the Pike’s Peak of idealism. And here’s congratulations
to Mr Zwaska for directing a few more telescopes at him.
